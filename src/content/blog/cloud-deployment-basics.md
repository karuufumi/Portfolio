## The premise

A deployment should make its own safety checks visible rather than relying on confidence or memory.

## Working through it

I look for a repeatable build, environment-specific configuration, a small health check, and a way to see the version currently running. These are simple controls, but they answer most of the questions that appear when a release behaves unexpectedly.

## Current takeaway

The goal is not an elaborate release platform. It is a deployment path that is predictable for the people who need to run and change the system.
