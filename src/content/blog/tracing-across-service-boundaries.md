## The premise

A request rarely stays inside one service. The hard part is preserving enough context to explain its path after it becomes asynchronous.

## Working through it

Propagating a correlation identifier across API calls, messages, and background jobs creates a shared handle for logs, traces, and operational questions. It should be treated as part of the system contract, not an afterthought.

## Current takeaway

Tracing starts with consistent context propagation. Tools become far more useful once the system provides a reliable thread to follow.
