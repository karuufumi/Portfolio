## The premise

Background jobs need to be designed around the assumption that a task can be retried, delayed, or observed twice.

## Working through it

A useful baseline is an idempotency key, bounded retries, and a dead-letter route that makes failed work visible instead of silent. Those pieces turn an unreliable queue consumer into a system with an understandable recovery path.

## Current takeaway

Before adding more infrastructure, make the job state inspectable. Knowing what ran, what failed, and what can be safely retried is more useful than a complex workflow with no operational story.
