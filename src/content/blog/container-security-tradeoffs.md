## The premise

A container is not automatically a safe test environment. Its isolation depends on the boundaries that are deliberately enforced.

## Working through it

Capabilities, mounted paths, network access, resource limits, and image provenance each answer a different risk question. Restricting one dimension while ignoring the others produces a reassuring but incomplete result.

## Current takeaway

Good sandboxing makes both the permitted behavior and the denied behavior observable and repeatable.
